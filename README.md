# Rory Whybrow Portfolio
This repository contains my digital portfolio, showcasing various aspects of my software development skills. 


# Uni-Soft Systems

The [Uni-Soft](./Uni-Soft) folder contains sample documentation/screenshots from the projects I worked on during my placement at Uni-Soft systems. 

## File Organiser
The [FileOrganiser](./Uni-Soft/FileOrganiser) folder contains several markdown readme files that I created for the FileOrganiser application whilst at Uni-Soft systems. The [HTML_Documentation](./Uni-Soft/FileOrganiser/HTML_Documentation) folder contains HTML files for the API documentation generated using pdoc (from docstrings).

## SegNet

The [SegNetVisualisation](./Uni-Soft/SegNetVisualisation) folder contains images that were produced by a convolutional neural network, that was trained to identify roof slopes from sattelite images. The images in the [SegnetEncoderDecoder](./Uni-Soft/SegNetVisualisation/SegnetEncoderDecoder) folder visualise the input an output channels of each encoding/decoding block layer. The images in the [TrainingProcess](./Uni-Soft/SegNetVisualisation/TrainingProcess) folder visualise the input/output and training data. The training data (far right column) consists of manually segmented images (black = background, red = roof slope, green = roof edge). 

# Game development

The [GameScreenshots](./GameScreenshots) folder contains screenshots from games that I am currently working on using Unity (C#). The majority of games are either unfinished (except solitaire) or only focus on implementation of technical tools such as voxel terrain generation.
