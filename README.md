This repository contains my digital portfolio, showcasing various aspects of my software development skills. For easily viewing images (GitHub website is not great at this), consider cloning this repository!


# Uni-Soft Systems

The [Uni-Soft](./Uni-Soft) folder contains sample documentation/screenshots from the projects I worked on during my placement at Uni-Soft systems. 

## File Organiser
The [FileOrganiser](./Uni-Soft/FileOrganiser) folder contains several markdown readme files that I created for the FileOrganiser application whilst at Uni-Soft systems. The [DocumentationSample](./Uni-Soft/FileOrganiser/DocumentationSample) folder contains a sample of the API documentation generated using pdoc (from docstrings). The sample files are PDFs generated from the HTML of the full source API (7 modules), with source code redacted.



## SegNet

The [SegNetVisualisation](./Uni-Soft/SegNetVisualisation) folder contains images that were produced by a convolutional neural network, that was trained to identify roof slopes from sattelite images. The images in the [SegnetEncoderDecoder](./Uni-Soft/SegNetVisualisation/SegnetEncoderDecoder) folder visualise the input an output channels of each encoding/decoding block layer. The images in the [TrainingProcess](./Uni-Soft/SegNetVisualisation/TrainingProcess) folder visualise the input/output and training data. The training data (far right column) consists of manually segmented images (black = background, red = roof slope, green = roof edge). 

## Misc

The [Misc](./Uni-Soft/Misc) folder contains several other miscellaneous files. 
- The [PythonStyleGuide](./Uni-Soft/Misc/PythonStyleGuide.md) contains the writing style guide for python that I produced for Uni-Soft, in line with PEP-8 and the company preferences.  
- The [WordpressMAMPReadme](./Uni-Soft/Misc/WordpressMAMPReadme.md) contains a readme for installing and restoring a bakcup copy of a cached WordPress site with MAMP, and how to edit various aspects of the site templates in PHP. 

# Game development

The [GameDevScreenshots](./GameDevScreenshots) folder contains screenshots from games that I am currently working on using Unity (C#). The majority of games are either unfinished (except solitaire) or only focus on implementation of technical tools such as voxel terrain generation.
