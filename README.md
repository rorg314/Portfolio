# Rory Whybrow Portfolio
This repository contains my digital portfolio, showcasing various aspects of my software development and documentation skills. For easily viewing images (GitHub website is not great at this), consider cloning this repository!


# Uni-Soft Systems

The [Uni-Soft](./Uni-Soft) folder contains sample readme documentation that I wrote whilst at Uni-Soft systems (only containing generic information, not pertaining to specific products developed by the company).
- The [PythonStyleGuide](./Uni-Soft/Misc/PythonStyleGuide.md) contains the writing style guide for python that I produced for Uni-Soft, in line with PEP-8 and the company preferences.  
- The [WordpressMAMPReadme](./Uni-Soft/Misc/WordpressMAMPReadme.md) contains a readme for installing and restoring a bakcup copy of a cached WordPress site with MAMP, and how to edit various aspects of the site templates in PHP. 

# Game development

The [GameDevScreenshots](./GameDevScreenshots) folder contains screenshots from games that I am currently working on using Unity (C#). The majority of games are either unfinished (except solitaire) or only focus on implementation of technical tools such as voxel terrain generation. See the individual repositories for each game for more information.
